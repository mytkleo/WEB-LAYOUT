	Quick Hummus recipe. This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
    It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. 
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
    It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

<blockquote cite ="https://www.webmd.com/diet/hummus-recipe-and-benefits">
<p><em>Hummus</em> that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. 
It deserves it. 
All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right. 
It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions.</strong>
